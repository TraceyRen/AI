# AI
Public clone of previous private project on AI.

## Search
Inplement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. 

## Multiagent
Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

## Reinforcement Learning
Implement Value Function, Q learning, and Approximate Q learning.

## Tacking 
Implement probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. 

## Machine Learning
Implement neural network models, and apply the models to several tasks including digit classification and language identification.

### Credits
The projects were developed by John DeNero, Dan Klein, Pieter Abbeel, and many others. http://ai.berkeley.edu
